              <h3>About me</h3>
              <p>
                Hello there! I&apos;m Conlin (but some internet folks call me
                Wuz). I am a senior software engineer (with management
                experience). I&apos;m fascinated by the intersection of art,
                community and technology.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have about 1000 hobbies and I&apos;m always excited to learn
                new things. This README is my personal &quot;documenation&quot;,
                a way for you to get to know what I care about and where my
                focuses lie.
              </p>
              <h3>Personal Principles</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Be a prism, not a mirror.</strong> Seek to digest and
                  break apart information, not just pass it on to someone else.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <strong>Optimize for consensus.</strong> Reject: kings,
                  presidents, and voting. Believe in: rough consensus and
                  exploratory tests.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Mistakes are how we learn.</strong> Failure is an
                  opportunity to learn something new.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>We all want to build a beautiful inn.</strong> Focus
                  on master, cooperation, and better work over stats-fiddling
                  and game-playing.
                </li>

                alt="If you do things because you want someone else to pat you on the head, you won’t get as good at it as someone who does it for internal satisfaction. We want the best-possible building. If we set up a system that makes people compete for acknowledgment, we invite game-playing and stats-fiddling, even unhealthy stuff like working stupid hours to beat everyone. A crew full of unhappy people doing substandard work. If you build systems that make people focus on mastery, cooperation, and better work, we’ll have a beautiful inn full of happy people working together well."

              </h3>
              <p>
                Alright, let&apos;s do this one more time. My name is Conlin
                Durbin and for the past 11-ish years I&apos;ve been writing and
                thinking about code. I started programming in high school,
                building Wordpress websites and creating custom plugins in PHP.
              </p>
              <p>
                I went to college, studied Computer Science, hated it. I
                switched majors to Economics and did software development on the
                side and fell in love with the range of subjects that let me
                study.
              </p>
              <p>
                I started a company in college, turned it into a consultancy and
                eventually ended it when my business partner graduated. I helped
                grow and build a coworking space in an old church and met some
                awesome people.
              </p>
              <p>
                After college, I started working at a software company called
                Mimir in West Lafayette, building an application for compiling,
                running, and grading programming homework for college computer
                science classes. I jumped to Lessonly after that, worked on a
                ton of different products initiatives there - all focused around
                helping people learn and grow in their jobs. I left that job and
                spent a little over a year at HackerRank, which was... a good
                learning opportunity. After a bunch of experiences that pushed
                me towards looking for a new job, I left and started at a
                startup called Agora in July 2021! Agora was acquired by
                Payscale in 2022 and they unfortunately cut our product and team
                in 2023. After a couple months of job hunting, I am excited to
                be starting as a Senior Frontend Engineer at Whatnot!
              </p>
              <p>
                I live in Indianapolis, Indiana with my partner Annadele and our
                three dogs and cats. It&apos;s a pretty hectic household at
                times, but we love it. I love cooking and I love playing
                tabletop RPG&apos;s like Dungeons and Dragons. I even play
                weekly in a live-stream called Sunset over Vengalia.

                Now that we&apos;re caught up, I&apos;ll explain a bit about
                myself today! Most of my life has been spent jumping from
                interest to interest, finding the things I like. Life by the
                accidents, if you will. I love learning new things and I have a
                ton of hobbies that include but are not limited to (in no
                particular order):

                <li>Talking about any of the above things for hours</li>

                I spend a lot of my free time thinking and writing about
                technology and hacking on side projects. Most of my side
                projects these days are focused on Dungeons and Dragons.
                Hopefully, this gives you a bit of an idea of who I am! Come
                chat with me, message me about grabbing a coffee, or just flag
                me down on Slack! I am always interested in chatting and getting
                to know more about people. The next section includes some
                information about my typical week and how I like to work. If you
                work closely with me, it might give you some more insight into
                what my job looks like and how I approach it. Feel free to skip
                it if you don&apos;t need to know that information!
