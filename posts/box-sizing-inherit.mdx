Just a quick post about some CSS interactions I recently ran into.

While recently working on a new design system, I discovered a strange
interaction with some CSS reset logic.

## Inheriting box-sizing

Based on
[this](https://css-tricks.com/inheriting-box-sizing-probably-slightly-better-best-practice/)
post, I decided to use

```css
html, :host {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
*, *:before, *:after {
  box-sizing: inherit;
}
```
instead of the usual:

```css
*, *:before, &:after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

It was working well until I was trying to fix some styling with a text input
inside of a `<details>` tag.

Turns out `slot`ted elements like the `<details>` content don't inherit
box-sizing correctly, instead falling back on to `content-box`.

I didn't have time to really dig in, so for now I'm back to the standard
version, that doesn't inherit anything. I'll do some more digging in the future
and see if it's possible to inherit box sizing correctly on those elements. If
anyone knows how to do that, I'd love to know!
