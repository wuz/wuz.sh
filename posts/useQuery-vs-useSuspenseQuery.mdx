If you've been around the GraphQL/React space for a bit now, you've probably run
into the `useQuery` and `useSuspenseQuery` hooks from `@apollo/client`.

These two components can be confusing. What is the difference? Which should you
use? Is one better than the other?


## Understanding Concurrent React

## Understanding Suspense

## `useQuery`

## `useSuspenseQuery`

## What is the difference?

## Which should I use?

Ultimately, this is up to you and the needs of your application.
`useSuspenseQuery` is more closely aligned to the direction that React is
heading and forces you to use modern React features like Suspense. `useQuery` is
simple to use and aligns with the `loading` prop pattern.

I'll be using `useSuspenseQuery` moving forward.

## Some patterns for using `useSuspenseQuery` without losing your mind

### Suspendable/Suspended Components in the same file

```tsx
type SuspendableComponentProps = {
  id: string;
};

const SuspendableComponent = ({id}: SuspendableComponentProps) => {
  const {data } = useSuspenseQuery(QUERY, {
    variables: {
      id,
      }
    });
  return <>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</>
};

const SuspendedComponent = (props: SuspendableComponentProps) => {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<Loader />}>
      <SuspendableComponent {...props} />
    </Suspense>
  );
};

export default SuspendedComponent;
```
