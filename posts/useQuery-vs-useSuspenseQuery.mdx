If you've been around the GraphQL/React space for a bit now, you've probably run
into the `useQuery` and `useSuspenseQuery` hooks from `@apollo/client`.

These two components can be confusing. What is the difference? Which should you
use? Is one better than the other?

## Understanding Concurrent React

## Understanding Suspense

## What is `useQuery`?

`useQuery` is the base hook for making GQL calls in a React frontend. It's
essentially a wrapper for `fetch` that makes it easier to make GQL requests and
parse the returned data. All querying happens on the frontend and it returns a
`loading` variable that is true when data is loading.

A typical `useQuery` looks something like this:

```tsx
const DataComponent = ({ id }) => {
  const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(GET_DATA, {
    variables: {
        id,
      }
  });

  if(loading) {
    return <Spinner />
  }

  if(error) {
    return <Error />
  }

  return (<div>
    {data?.map((item) => <RenderItem item={item} />)}
  </div>);
};
```

Importantly, nothing here can render until it hits the client - `useQuery` can't
use server-side rendering to preload data.

## What is `useSuspenseQuery`?

`useSuspenseQuery`

A typical `useSuspenseQuery` looks something like this:

```tsx
const DataComponent = ({ id }) => {
  const { data, error } = useSuspenseQuery(GET_DATA, {
    variables: {
        id,
      }
  });

  if(error) {
    return <Error />
  }

  return (<div>
    {data?.map((item) => <RenderItem item={item} />)}
  </div>);
};
```

Instead of a `loading` prop that renders a Spinner, we can wrap this component
in a `<Suspense>` boundary:

```tsx
const Parent = ({id}) => {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
      <DataComponent id={id} />
    </Suspense>
  );
};
```

At first glance, this might seem more complicated than a simple `loading` prop,
but since we're no longer rendering based on a specific `loading` state, we have
more control over the suspense of the component. Anytime the `<DataComponent />`
suspends, we'll get a nice loading state.

## What is the difference?

## Which should I use?

Ultimately, this is up to you and the needs of your application.
`useSuspenseQuery` is more closely aligned to the direction that React is
heading and forces you to use modern React features like Suspense. `useQuery` is
simple to use and aligns with the `loading` prop pattern.

I'll be using `useSuspenseQuery` moving forward.

## Some patterns for using `useSuspenseQuery` without losing your mind

### Suspendable/Suspended Components in the same file

```tsx
type SuspendableComponentProps = {
  id: string;
};

const SuspendableComponent = ({id}: SuspendableComponentProps) => {
  const {data } = useSuspenseQuery(QUERY, {
    variables: {
      id,
      }
    });
  return <>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</>
};

const SuspendedComponent = (props: SuspendableComponentProps) => {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<Loader />}>
      <SuspendableComponent {...props} />
    </Suspense>
  );
};

export default SuspendedComponent;
```
